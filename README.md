# Webbed
- One stop resource guide for web development.
- Aiming to create the best website to start your self-learning journey!

Started on 3rd September 2021

# MOTIVE
Whenever we think of self-learning anything, we often struggle finding the perfect resources to study from. Be it documentations, youtube videos or courses, we always look for the tried and tested ones.
So here we decided to find a feasible solution to this problem by creating a website which lists doen all the resources which are quite famous and tried and tested by many people.

# CURRENT FEATURES
Currently the website offers resources related to web-development - HTML, CSS and JS.
Initially on the homepage we have a roadmap for web developement which leads to the respective resources. 
The resources page can also be accessed indivisually from the navbar.
For the resources we have included some youtube links, some free courses and some documentations which helped us in our journey.

# FUTURE ASPECTS
1) Our aim is to include as many domains as possible and provide multiple choices for resources.
2) We also plan to include a editor dashboard wherein a user can watch a youtube video and make notes side by side as well as download those notes too.
3) We also plan to add a BLOG section wherein we will be posting regular updates in the field of technology, some not so common facts and personal expieriences. This would help us build a community of like minded people.
